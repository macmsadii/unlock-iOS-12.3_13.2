unlock iphone 12.3_13.2
* First How to unlock (12.3 _ 13.2 ) :
Work principle the chackra1n in unlock iCloud :
1. IPhone jailbreak work when closed due to iCloud and need activation  .
2. After that, I stop the IMEI number which is considered the ID of the iPhone with Apple .
3. Then the iPhone opens but not completely, because when you delete the IMEI number the sim card will not work, and this is sure because it is a kind of iPhone protection, but the sim card can be played on Turbo SIM or FLAYYSIM .
* All that can do on ( checkar1n , checkm8.info iCloud bypass ) and update Xcode on terminal  .
* So, with ease, iCloud broke from 12.3 _ 13.2 *
